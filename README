This is a PHP script I partially barrowed, tweaked, and cobbled together over the years.

It is designed to log into an IMAP email server, read the messages off the server, and parse out the message content and any attachments, then delete the message.

What you do with the parsed output is up to you... You could save the attachments to a directory... You could save the text content to a database... You could forward the messages on... It's all up to you!

Practical applications for this might be giving website users the ability to post photos and or comments via email.

I welcome any modifications you may have.  Feel free to pull/clone and tweak as you see fit.
